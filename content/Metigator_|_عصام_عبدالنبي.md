The channel aims to provide structured and correct scientific content for who wants to be Full Stack Developer We all know the extent of the challenges those interested in programming may face, 1. A massive influx of technology does not give us time 2. Distraction in choosing the direction due to the large number of options 3. Difficulty learning everything from one source 4. Lack of a solid base of programming skills For all of the above, I created this channel, which aims to solve all these challenges, God willing
